1. Some stars hover around the center of the cluster, while some other get kicked out to the cluster outskirts or even leave the cluster altogether. 
   I think that we can predict where a star will be at any given time based on its initial position and velocity.

2. Star Cluster Simulations
   Direct N-body simulation of a star cluster: Position and velocities of stars

3. All the data files are in type csv.There are eight colunms in every file, x, y, z, vx, vy ,vz, m, id, respectively


4. I think that we can predict the start clusters state which may dissolve quickly or be very long lived by the datas.
